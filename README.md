# HNProfile - Profile Overlay for Hacker News

HNProfile lets you quickly glance at a user's profile without leaving the page
you're on. You can quickly see a user's bio, karma, account age - plus quick
links to their comments and submissions. Plus, if they have an email address
or Github account in their bio (providing they've set up a Gravatar or Github
avatar), you'll see their avatar too.

HNProfile is available for Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Most users will want to
grab a copy from the appropriate extensions / addon store.
